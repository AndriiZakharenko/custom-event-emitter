# Custom Event Emitter

## 🎮 About the Project
I created a custom class `MyEventEmitter` that mimics the behavior of Node.js's built-in `EventEmitter`. This class allows you to emit events and register listeners for those events, handling asynchronous event-driven programming.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Node.js** (For building the custom event emitter and handling asynchronous events)

## 🛠️ Tools & Dependencies
- **ESLint** – For ensuring code quality and consistency  
- **Prettier** – For automatic code formatting  
- **Jest** – For testing the event emitter functionality  

## 📌 Features
✅ Custom `MyEventEmitter` class for event management  
✅ Supports registering multiple listeners for events  
✅ Can emit events with data and execute the listeners in the order they were registered  

## 🌐 Demo
Clone the repository, install dependencies, and use the `MyEventEmitter` class to register and emit events in your Node.js applications.
